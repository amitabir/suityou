* after checkout the cart as  unsubscribed user, should refer to sign up page. need also logic on sign up page that if the user came from checkout retrun him to it. 

* Need to split cloths between more designers 

* try to retarget images to thier frame. - found a way: need to finish for all img see example at show_match.php and relevant part in style/style.css   

* bug found: if you have completed all matches at matching with one user all signed up users have finished too. page: matching.php logged in as any user.
